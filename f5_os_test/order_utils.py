    AGENT_LB_DEL_ORDER is an example weights table.  Pass it as the second
    argument where the first is a list of BigIP device URIs and it will return
    a list with the resources in the appropriate order for deletion.
    Note that URIS that do not match a key in the weights table are set to have
    the same "high" weight.   Their relative order will not change.
